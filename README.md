# Dopex Frontend Registry

- [Dopex Frontends List](LIST.md)

## What are Dopex frontends?

Dopex features a frontend registry aiming to enhance the decentralization and resistance to censorship of its system.

## What is the Frontend Registry?

This Frontend Registry is a place for Dopex Frontend Operators to make their existence known in order to get added to the [Dopex.io Frontend Registry](https://dopex.io/frontends).

## How do I get my frontend added to the registry?

To add your frontend to the registry, please refer to the following [guidelines and PR template](REGISTRY-GUIDELINES.md). Any PRs that deviate from the template _will not be added_. Also, please consider the uniqueness of your frontend relative to its peers. Many people will spin up Launch Kits, but consider why users may choose your frontend over another.

_Note: Getting added to the registry is not an automated process, therefore there is no guaranteed timeline for getting your PR accepted. Please be patient._

## How do I report a malicious frontend?

If you have reason to believe a frontend is a risk to users, please follow the [reporting guidelines here](REPORT-FRONTEND.md).
