# Registry Guidelines and PR Template

To pepare your frontend for inclusion in the registry, you must first submit a pull request that adds a new `.md` file to the `frontends` folder. We've made [example.md](frontends/example.md) available as a reference.

In your frontend's `.md` file, please include the following information:

- Website URL:
- Hosted on:
- Date launched:
- Owner:
- Contact (email, Discord, Twitter etc.):
- Description:

After which, your frontend may be added to the Github registry, then the dopex.io registry.
